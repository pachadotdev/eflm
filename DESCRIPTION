Description: Efficient Fitting of Linear and Generalized Linear Models by using
  just base R. As an alternative to lm() and glm(), this package provides elm()
  and eglm(), with a significant speedup when the number of 
  observations is larger than the number of parameters to estimate. The speed
 gains are obtained by reducing the NxP model matrix to a PxP matrix, and the 
 best computational performance is obtained when R is linked against OpenBLAS,
 Intel MKL or other optimized BLAS library. This implementation aims at being
 compatible with 'broom' and 'sandwich' packages for summary statistics and
 clustering by providing S3 methods.
